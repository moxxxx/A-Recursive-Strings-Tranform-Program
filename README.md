A string that is written in "Snake Case" uses only lowercase letters and each word is separated by an underscore. Any word can be written in "Pig Latin" by removing all the characters in the word (starting from the left and moving to the right, up to but not including the leftmost vowel (specifically one of "A", "E", "I", "O", or "U") contained in the word. Without changing their order, these characters must be appended to the end of the word, and then the characters "AY" must be appended to the end of that.
As a clarifying example, the "Snake Case" string:
                          "robert_is_thirty_eight"
and then each word would be converted to "Pig Latin":
["obertray", "isay", "irtythay", "eightay"]
